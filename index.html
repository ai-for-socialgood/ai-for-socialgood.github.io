                      <p class="text-justify font-weight-light mx-2">COVID modeling and prediction is a crowded area, but in this instance, more crowd is better. We study the fundamental AI and Machine learning challenges relevant to COVID prediction, and how we addressed those challenges. One has to pin down what we would like to learn from the data, and reconcile that with what we can learn from the data. What we can learn from the data tells us what is happening as opposed to what we think ought to happen. Focusing on what we can learn drove our focus toward simple local models with robust change-point analysis and model identification. Our approach allows data at the county-level to dictate the learning for a county, which allows us to infer quantities such as the number of infectious and immune individuals at a county-level. Such quantities are not easy to deduce from other models or without extensive infection and/or antibody testing. Our algorithms are fully automated and in a team effort, we have produced two useful tools: COVID War-Room and COVID Back-to-School. Most of our results will be drawn from these tools.</p>

                          <p><b>Invited Talk: Friends Don’t Let Friends Deploy Black-Box Models: The Importance of Intelligibility in Machine Learning</b></p>
                          <p class="text-justify font-weight-light mx-2">It’s more dangerous to deploy a black-box ML model than you think --- there are bad things lurking in all models.  We have developed a machine learning method based on generalized additive models (GAMs) that is as accurate as full complexity models like boosted trees, random forests and neural nets, but even more intelligible than linear and logistic regression models on tabular data.  This makes it easy to understand what a model has learned and to edit the model when it learns inappropriate things.  In the talk I’ll present case studies where these high-accuracy GAMs discover surprising patterns in data that would have made deploying a black-box model risky or unfair.</p>

                              <p class="text-justify">As AI has increasingly integrated in every walk of life and affecting the lives of billions of people, more than a hundred frameworks have proliferated globally from various governments and large organizations. However, a perspective that combines the concerns of peripheral actors in the AI world and small nations is largely missing. In this talk I shall give a brief overview of the benefits that AI can offer to small nations and marginalized groups. I will also use this as an opportunity to implore the AI community to focus their efforts towards a big tent approach that respects such concerns.</p>

                                    <p class="lead text-justify">The overarching topic of this seminar is centered on the design and development of novel human computer interfaces that seamlessly integrate with a user’s mind, body and behavior, providing an enhanced perception. We call this ‘Assistive Augmentation’. Creating such Assistive Augmentations poses a twofold challenge as they require a novel input and interactions as well as a holistic design approach. Using modern biological understanding of sensation, emerging electronic devices, computational methods and design thinking approach, we now have an opportunity to design a new generation of Assistive Augmentations. This talk will present several proof of concept Assistive Augmentations for enhancing human I/O in the focus areas of assistive technologies, novel input strategies, smart health and well-being, and interactive learning technologies.</p>

Before joining UoA, Suranga was an Assistant Professor at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and a Postdoctoral Associate at the Fluid Interfaces group, MIT Media Lab. He received his PhD in 2010 and BEng in 2005 from the National University of Singapore. In 2011, he founded the "Augmented Human Lab" to explore ways of creating ‘enabling’ human-computer interfaces as natural extensions of our body, mind and behaviour. His work is most important to the people whose lives it most directly impacts: those who face challenged to function in the world due to sensory deficits in hearing or vision. What also makes Suranga’s contributions important is that they are not only applicable to those specific communities. Because of his emphasis on “enabling” rather than “fixing,” the technologies that Suranga has developed have a potentially much broader range of applications. With publications in prestigious conferences, demonstrations, patents, media coverage and real-world deployments, Suranga has demonstrated the potential of advancing the state-of-the art in Assistive Human-Computer Interfaces. For the totality and breadth of achievements, he has won many awards including young inventor under 35 (TR35 award) in the Asia Pacific region by MIT TechReview, Outstanding Young Persons of Sri Lanka (TOYP), and INK Fellowship 2016.</small></p>

                <p class="lead text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b>COVID modeling and prediction is a crowded area, but in this instance, more crowd is better. We study the fundamental AI and Machine learning challenges relevant to COVID prediction, and how we addressed those challenges. One has to pin down what we would like to learn from the data, and reconcile that with what we can learn from the data. What we can learn from the data tells us what is happening as opposed to what we think ought to happen. Focusing on what we can learn drove our focus toward simple local models with robust change-point analysis and model identification. Our approach allows data at the county-level to dictate the learning for a county, which allows us to infer quantities such as the number of infectious and immune individuals at a county-level. Such quantities are not easy to deduce from other models or without extensive infection and/or antibody testing. Our algorithms are fully automated and in a team effort, we have produced two useful tools: COVID War-Room and COVID Back-to-School. Most of our results will be drawn from these tools.</p>

                  <span class="text-muted">Rich Caruana</span></h3>
                  <p class="lead text-justify"><b>Abstract:</b> It’s more dangerous to deploy a black-box ML model than you think --- there are bad things lurking in all models.  We have developed a machine learning method based on generalized additive models (GAMs) that is as accurate as full complexity models like boosted trees, random forests and neural nets, but even more intelligible than linear and logistic regression models on tabular data.  This makes it easy to understand what a model has learned and to edit the model when it learns inappropriate things.  In the talk I’ll present case studies where these high-accuracy GAMs discover surprising patterns in data that would have made deploying a black-box model risky or unfair.</p>

However, a perspective that combines the concerns of peripheral actors in the AI world and small nations is largely missing. In this talk I shall give a brief overview of the benefits that AI can offer to small nations and marginalized groups. I will also use this as an opportunity to implore the AI community to focus their efforts towards a big tent approach that respects such concerns.</p>

We call this ‘Assistive Augmentation’. Creating such Assistive Augmentations poses a twofold challenge as they require a novel input and interactions as well as a holistic design approach. Using modern biological understanding of sensation, emerging electronic devices, computational methods and design thinking approach, we now have an opportunity to design a new generation of Assistive Augmentations. This talk will present several proof of concept Assistive Augmentations for enhancing human I/O in the focus areas of assistive technologies, novel input strategies, smart health and well-being, and interactive learning technologies.</p>

                <p class="text-justify"><b>Bio:</b> Suranga Nanayakkara is an Associate Professor at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute, the University of Auckland (UoA). Before joining UoA, Suranga was an Assistant Professor at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and a Postdoctoral Associate at the Fluid Interfaces group, MIT Media Lab. He received his PhD in 2010 and BEng in 2005 from the National University of Singapore. In 2011, he founded the "Augmented Human Lab" to explore ways of creating ‘enabling’ human-computer interfaces as natural extensions of our body, mind and behaviour. His work is most important to the people whose lives it most directly impacts: those who face challenged to function in the world due to sensory deficits in hearing or vision. What also makes Suranga’s contributions important is that they are not only applicable to those specific communities. Because of his emphasis on “enabling” rather than “fixing,” the technologies that Suranga has developed have a potentially much broader range of applications. With publications in prestigious conferences, demonstrations, patents, media coverage and real-world deployments, Suranga has demonstrated the potential of advancing the state-of-the art in Assistive Human-Computer Interfaces. For the totality and breadth of achievements, he has won many awards including young inventor under 35 (TR35 award) in the Asia Pacific region by MIT TechReview, Outstanding Young Persons of Sri Lanka (TOYP), and INK Fellowship 2016.</p>

        <h2>Symposium Scope</h2>
        
        <p class="text-justify">Recent developments in the availability of big data and computational power are continuing to revolutionize several domains opening up new opportunities and challenges. In this symposium, we highlight two specific themes of humanitarian relief and healthcare where AI could be used for social good to achieve the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals in those areas, which touch every aspect of human, social, and economic development. We expect the symposium to identify the critical needs and pathways for responsible AI solutions for achieving the sustainable goals, which demand holistic thinking on optimizing the trade-off between automation benefits and their potential side-effects.</p> 
        
        <p  class="text-justify">AI technology can have an incredible impact on how we address humanitarian issues and achieve developmental goals around the world. Detecting and predicting how a crisis or conflict could develop, analyzing the impact of catastrophes in a cyber-physical society, and assisting in disaster response as well as resource allocation are of utmost importance, and the advances in AI can be utilized in many such tasks. These techniques can allow better preparation for emergencies, help save lives, limit economic losses, provide adequate disaster relief, and make communities stronger and more resilient. This symposium will focus on all aspects of humanitarian relief operations supported by the novel use of AI technologies from enabling missing persons to be located, leveraging crowdsourced data to provide early warning for rapid response to emergencies, increasing situational awareness, to logistics and supply chain management.</p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">Similarly, healthcare is one of the foremost challenges of today’s world, highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic where it has come to the forefront of the global discourse. In general, the healthcare data is characterized by missing data, lack of data standardization, data incompleteness, etc., which hinders the deployment of solutions that are relevant to real-world use cases. Moreover, AI/ML in healthcare is characterized by the last mile problem, where delivering a practical solution that is reliable, robust to errors (especially in “break glass in case of emergency” situations), and graceful degradation has proven hard to implement. These have broader implications in the context of fairness, explainability, and transparency. Therefore, implementation and deployment of AI/ML systems in production in healthcare bring up challenges which go far beyond model building and scoring. This symposium will also focus on a broad range of AI healthcare applications and challenges encountered including but not limited to: automation bias, prescriptive AI models, explainability, privacy and security, transparency, decision rights, and so on, especially in the context of deployment of AI in healthcare.</p>
        
        <p  class="text-justify">The proposed symposium builds upon our continued efforts in bringing the AI community members together for the above-mentioned themes and also, our </a href="2019/index.html">last year’s successful AAAI Fall Series symposium on AI for Social Good</a>. Further, our symposium builds upon the lessons from the 2015 AAAI Spring Symposium on Structured Data for Humanitarian Technologies organized by some of the authors of this proposal. </p>
        
        <p  class="text-justify">This symposium will bring together AI researchers, domain scientists, and policymakers to exchange problems and solutions, to identify synergies across different application domains, and to lead to future collaborative efforts.<p>
